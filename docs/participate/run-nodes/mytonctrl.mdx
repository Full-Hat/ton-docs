# MyTonCtrl

## Overview

To install and manage your own node, use the **MyTonCtrl** open-source tool developed by the TON Foundation. The majority of TON Nodes are reliable and tested by **MyTonCtrl**.

[MyTonCtrl](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl) is a console application that is a convenient wrapper for fift, lite-client, and validator-engine-console. It has been specifically developed to streamline wallet, domain, and validator management tasks on the Linux operating system.

Actually, there is [MyTonCtrl2](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/tree/mytonctrl2) with a lot of improvements ([single nominator pool](/participate/network-maintenance/single-nominator), more checks, etc.). But now it is under development and can be unstable.

We are actively seeking feedback about the installation process. If you have any questions or suggestions, please [contact us](https://t.me/Alexgton).

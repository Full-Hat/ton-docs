# MyTonCtrl

## Overview

To install and manage your own node, use the **MyTonCtrl** open-source tool developed by the TON Foundation. The majority of TON Nodes are reliable and tested by **MyTonCtrl**.

[MyTonCtrl](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl) is a console application that is a convenient wrapper for fift, lite-client, and validator-engine-console. It has been specifically developed to streamline wallet, domain, and validator management tasks on the Linux operating system.

Actually, there is [MyTonCtrl2](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mytonctrl/tree/mytonctrl2) with a lot of improvements ([single nominator pool](/participate/network-maintenance/single-nominator), more checks, etc.). But now it is under development and can be unstable.

We are actively seeking feedback about the installation process. If you have any questions or suggestions, please [contact us](https://t.me/Alexgton).


## Wallet management 

### Importing a wallet

MyTonCtrl2 supports various types of wallet-like contracts, including wallet-v1, wallet-v3, [lockup-wallet](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/lockup-wallet-contract/tree/main/universal), and others. Often, it provides a straightforward way to interact with these contracts.

#### Importing Using a Private Key

If you have access to a private key, you can easily import a wallet:

```bash
MyTonCtrl> iw <wallet-addr> <wallet-secret-key>
```

Here, `<wallet-secret-key>` is your private key in base64 format.

#### Importing Using a Mnemonic Phrase

If you have a mnemonic phrase (a sequence of 24 words like `tattoo during ...`), follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js.
2. Clone and install [mnemonic2key](https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mnemonic2key):
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/ton-blockchain/mnemonic2key.git
    cd mnemonic2key
    npm install
    ```
3. Run the following command, replacing `word1`, `word2`... with your mnemonic phrase and `address` with the address of your wallet contract:
    ```
    node index.js word1 word2 ... word24 [address]
    ```
4. The script will generate `wallet.pk` and `wallet.addr`. Rename them to `imported_wallet.pk` and `imported_wallet.addr`.
5. Copy both files to the `~/.local/share/mytoncore/wallets/` directory.
6. Open the mytonctrl console and list the wallets using the `wl` command.
7. Verify that the wallet has been imported and displays the correct balance.
8. You can now send funds using the `mg` command. Enter `mg` to view the help documentation.
Remember to replace placeholders (words inside `< >`) with your actual values when running commands.
